Prntr Board V1
======================
PrntrBoard is a 3D printer controller board designed to work with STM32 NUCLEO dev kits. The current version (V1) supports NUCLEO-64 series kits. The design is being developed on F446-RE kit, but other models could work as well. IMO the STM32F446 NUCLEO-64 kit offers very good performance (180MHz CPU) for the price ($15).

THIS BRANCH IS DEPRECATED. CHECK THE `tmc2660` OR `tmc2130` BRANCH FOR UPDATES.
